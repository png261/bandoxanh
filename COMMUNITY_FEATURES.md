```

## 📁 Files Created

### API Routes:
- `/app/api/users/[id]/follow/route.ts` - Follow/unfollow endpoints
- `/app/api/posts/[id]/react/route.ts` - Reaction endpoints

### Hooks:

<FollowButton userId={userId} />
```

```tsx
import ReactionPicker from '@/components/ReactionPicker';

<ReactionPicker postId={postId} onReact={() => console.log('Reacted!')} />
```

### Follow Stats

import { useFollow } from '@/hooks/useFollow';

const { stats, toggleFollow } = useFollow(userId);
// stats.followersCount, stats.followingCount, stats.isFollowing
```

## 📝 Next Steps (Not Implemented Yet)

1. **Integrate components into Community page:**
   - Replace like button with ReactionPicker
   - Add FollowButton to user profiles
   - Display followers/following stats

2. **Hashtag functionality:**
   - Parse hashtags when creating posts
   - Create hashtag search/browse page
   - Show trending hashtags

3. **Feed filtering:**
   - "Following" tab - posts from followed users only
   - "Trending" tab - sort by engagement
   - "Nearby" tab - location-based posts

4. **Notifications:**
   - Display notification bell in Header
   - Notification dropdown
   - Mark as read functionality

## 🐛 Known Issues

- TypeScript errors will appear until Prisma client is regenerated
- Migration needs to be run to create new database tables
- Existing posts won't have hashtags (only new posts)

## 🎯 Priority Implementation Order

1. Run migration (REQUIRED)
2. Integrate ReactionPicker into Community posts
3. Add FollowButton to user profiles
4. Display follower stats
5. Implement hashtag extraction when creating posts
6. Create notification UI
